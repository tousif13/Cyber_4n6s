`Local Time = UTC + (Local Time Offset)`

## Exercise 1

### 1. Convert the following timestamps from their local timezone to UTC

### a. 07/03/2021 15:05:00 EDT

    UTC = 15:05:00 - (-4)

    07/03/2021 19:05:00 UTC
### b. 05/03/2018 19:30:16 PST

    UTC = 19:30:16 - (-8)
    
    05/04/2018 02:30:16 UTC

### c. 11/05/2020 03:45:00 AEST

    UTC = 03:45:00 - (+10)
    
    11/04/2020 17:45:00 UTC
    
### d. 01/23/2019 23:33:02 CST

    UTC = 23:33:02 - (-6)
    
    01/24/2019 05:33:02
